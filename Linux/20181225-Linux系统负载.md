### 1. load average 
查看系统平均负载:
uptime, top, w 命令都可以查看系统的平均负载。

```
[root@myfedora ~]# uptime
 11:32:28 up 1 day,  9:30,  6 users,  load average: 0.05, 0.06, 0.02

 load average 3个数值 分别表示 1 5 15分钟的系统平均负载。
 5秒刷新一次
```
### 2. 如何理解系统负载
首先看 man uptime中的一段话:
```
System  load  averages is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable
or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is either  using  the  CPU  or
waiting  to  use  the  CPU.  A process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O
access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are taken over  the  three  time  intervals.
Load  averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a load average
of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it  means
it was idle 75% of the time.
```
